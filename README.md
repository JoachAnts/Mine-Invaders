# Mine-Invaders 

Mine Invaders is a very simple game that I made in about June 2014, to introduce myself to game development. It's inspired by the likes of Space Invaders with Minecraft as the game's theme. I drew the game's art resources myself and they are quite terrible, I must admit. I have not uploaded the sound assets for the game to avoid any copyright issues.
